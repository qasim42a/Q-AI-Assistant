Here is an article on "Even and Odd Numbers in C++":

In programming, it is often necessary to determine whether a number is even or odd. In C++, you can use conditional statements to check whether a number is even or odd.

An even number is a whole number that is exactly divisible by 2, whereas an odd number is a whole number that is not exactly divisible by 2.

Here is a simple program in C++ that checks whether a number is even or odd:

```cpp
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int num;

    cout << "Enter a number: ";
    cin >> num;

    if(num % 2 == 0)
        cout << num << " is an even number.";
    else
        cout << num << " is an odd number.";

    return 0;
}
```

In this program, we first take an integer input from the user. Then, we use the modulus operator `%` to find the remainder of the number when divided by 2. If the remainder is 0, the number is even; otherwise, it is odd.

Here is another way to solve this problem using functions:

```cpp
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

bool isEven(int num) {
    if(num % 2 == 0)
        return true;
    else
        return false;
}

int main() {
    int num;

    cout << "Enter a number: ";
    cin >> num;

    if(isEven(num))
        cout << num << " is an even number.";
    else
        cout << num << " is an odd number.";

    return 0;
}
```

In this program, we define a function `isEven` that takes an integer as an argument and returns a boolean value indicating whether the number is even or odd. Then, we use this function in our main function to check whether the number is even or odd.
