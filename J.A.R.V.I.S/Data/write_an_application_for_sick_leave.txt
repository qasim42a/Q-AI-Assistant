Dear [Recipient's Name],

I am writing to request a sick leave for the next [number of days] days, starting from [start date] and ending on [end date]. Due to unforeseen health circumstances, I am currently not in a position to report to work and need some time to recover.

I am experiencing [briefly mention the nature of your illness or medical condition, e.g. flu, fever, etc.]. My doctor has advised me to take some time off to rest and recover, and I am following their guidance.

I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause and will do my best to catch up on any missed work as soon as I am feeling better. I will also be available by email if any urgent matters arise during my absence.

I would like to request your approval for the sick leave and appreciate your understanding in this matter. Please let me know if any additional documentation or information is required.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Sincerely,
