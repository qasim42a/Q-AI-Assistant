Dear [Friend's Name],

I hope this message finds you in good health and high spirits. I was just thinking about you and wanted to reach out to see how life has been treating you lately.

I've been keeping busy with work and haven't had as much time to catch up with friends as I'd like. However, I've been thinking about our last conversation and the funny story you told me about [shared memory]. It still makes me laugh every time I think about it.

I was also thinking about our shared love of [hobby or interest] and was wondering if you've had a chance to try out [new technique or project]. I'd love to hear about your experiences and maybe even swap tips and advice.

If you're free, I was thinking we could grab coffee or lunch sometime soon and catch up in person. Let me know a good time that works for you and I'll make sure to clear my schedule.

Take care and talk to you soon,

[Your Name]
