Here is an example of C++ code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int num1, num2, sum;

    cout << "Enter the first number: ";
    cin >> num1;
    cout << "Enter the second number: ";
    cin >> num2;

    sum = num1 + num2;

    cout << "The sum of the numbers is: " << sum << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

This code is a simple program that calculates the sum of two numbers. It uses the `cin` object to get the numbers from the user and the `cout` object to display the result. The `sum` variable is used to store the sum of the two numbers.
