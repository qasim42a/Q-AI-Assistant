Here is a Java code snippet that demonstrates a simple program to calculate the area of a rectangle:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class RectangleArea {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        System.out.println("Enter the length of the rectangle:");
        double length = scanner.nextDouble();

        System.out.println("Enter the width of the rectangle:");
        double width = scanner.nextDouble();

        double area = length * width;

        System.out.println("The area of the rectangle is: " + area);
    }
}
```

In this code, we first import the `java.util.Scanner` class, which allows us to get input from the user. We then create a `Scanner` object called `scanner` and use it to get the length and width of the rectangle from the user.

We then calculate the area of the rectangle by multiplying the length and width together. Finally, we print out the area to the console.

This is a very basic program, and you could easily expand on it to handle more complex cases, such as getting the dimensions from a file or database, or calculating the perimeter of the rectangle as well.
